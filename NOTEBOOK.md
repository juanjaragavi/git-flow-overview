Your task is to output possible code examples of the API Endpoints collection, based on the following workarounds:

## 1. Dockerization:

Given your expertise and the mention of Docker in your profile, consider dockerizing your FastAPI application. This ensures that your application runs in the same environment, both locally and on the Azure VM.
Use a Dockerfile to define the environment and dependencies. Then, build a Docker image and run it as a container on the Azure VM.

## 2. Change the framework:

Replace FastAPI with Flask.

The Git flow workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. The main components are:

- **Main (or Master)**: This branch contains production-ready code.
- **Develop**: This branch contains features that are ready for the next release.
- **Feature branches**: Branches created for new features or issues.
- **Release branches**: Branches that prepare the next production release.
- **Hotfix branches**: Branches that quickly patch production releases.

## 2. Initial Setup:

Ensure you have the latest version of your repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juanjaragavi/juan-jaramillo-api-endpoints.git
cd juan-jaramillo-api-endpoints
```

### GitHub Desktop:

1. Open GitHub Desktop.
2. Click on `File` > `Clone Repository`.
3. Choose the `URL` tab and enter the repository's URL, then click `Clone`.

## 3. Development Workflow:

### Starting a new feature:

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### GitHub Desktop:

1. Make sure you are on the `develop` branch.
2. Fetch the latest changes.
3. Click the `Current Branch` dropdown and choose `New Branch`, name it `feature/your-feature-name`.

### Finishing a feature:

After finishing the development and testing of your feature:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Completed feature/your-feature-name"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### GitHub Desktop:

1. Make your changes and then click on `Commit to feature/your-feature-name`.
2. Click the `Publish Branch` button to push your feature branch to the remote.

## 4. Preparing for a Release:

### Creating a release branch:

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/vX.Y.Z
```

### GitHub Desktop:

1. Make sure you're on the `develop` branch.
2. Fetch the latest changes.
3. Click the `Current Branch` dropdown and choose `New Branch`, name it `release/vX.Y.Z`.

### Finishing a release:

After final testing:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge release/vX.Y.Z
git push origin main
git checkout develop
git merge release/vX.Y.Z
git push origin develop
git branch -d release/vX.Y.Z
```

### GitHub Desktop:

1. Change to the `main` branch.
2. Choose `Merge into Current Branch` under the `Branch` menu and select your release branch.
3. Push the changes to `main`.
4. Repeat the merge process for the `develop` branch.
5. Delete the release branch by right-clicking it in the `Current Branch` dropdown.

## 5. Hotfixes:

Hotfixes are branches that derive from `main` and are meant to fix critical issues.

### Creating a hotfix branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/your-hotfix-name
```

### GitHub Desktop:

1. Make sure you're on the `main` branch.
2. Fetch the latest changes.
3. Click the `Current Branch` dropdown and choose `New Branch`, name it `hotfix/your-hotfix-name`.

### Finishing a hotfix:

After the hotfix is tested:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/your-hotfix-name
git push origin main
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/your-hotfix-name
git push origin develop
git branch -d hotfix/your-hotfix-name
```

### GitHub Desktop:

1. Change to the `main` branch.
2. Choose `Merge into Current Branch` under the `Branch` menu and select your hotfix branch.
3. Push the changes to `main`.
4. Repeat the merge process for the `develop` branch.
5. Delete the hotfix branch by right-clicking it in the `Current Branch` dropdown.

**Note**: Ensure you regularly merge `develop` into your feature branches to avoid large merge conflicts.

To revert all changes made in the `develop` branch and make it identical to the `main` branch using the Git flow strategy, you can follow these steps:

1. **Make sure you're in the `develop` branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   ```

2. **Fetch the latest changes**:
   This ensures you have the latest state of both `develop` and `main` branches.
   ```bash
   git fetch
   ```

3. **Reset the `develop` branch to the `main` branch**:
   ```bash
   git reset --hard origin/main
   ```

   This command will make the `develop` branch's pointer point to the same commit as `main` branch's pointer, effectively discarding all changes in `develop` since it diverged from `main`.

4. **Push the changes to the remote repository**:
   Since you've rewritten the history of the `develop` branch, you'll need to forcefully push the changes to the remote repository.
   ```bash
   git push origin develop --force
   ```

   ⚠️ Be cautious when using `--force` as it can overwrite changes on the remote that you don't have locally. It's good practice to communicate with your team before performing such actions to ensure no work is lost.

Now, the `develop` branch will be in the exact same state as the `main` branch.

Remember to always backup or ensure you have other means to recover your work before performing destructive operations like these.

To switch to the `main` branch, you simply use the `git checkout` command. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
git checkout main
```

If you're using Git version 2.23 or later, you can also use the `git switch` command, which is more intuitive for this kind of task:

```bash
git switch main
```

After running either of these commands, you'll be on the `main` branch. You can confirm this by running:

```bash
git branch
```

The currently active branch will be indicated with an asterisk (*) next to its name.
